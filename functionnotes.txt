the variable inside the parameter ex:name is called  parameter but the value is inside is called argument ex:alice,aline

anonymus function is the function without a name that can be assigned to a variable like this

when the return is not specified we are gonna get an error called undefined

ARROW FUNCTIONS
first what is the noremal functions this means are reusabke peices of code that help your code more modular, easier to mantain and more efficient.

when we create the arrow functions in js we dont have to write the word function
ðŸ‘‰ You remove the function keyword and add => between the parameters and the body.
if the function has one statement that retun a value, you can remove the {} and the return keywords
if also there is only one parameter there is gonna be no reason to add the ()

ex: const greet = name =>"Hello"+name;
same as
const greet=(name)=>"Hello"+name;
